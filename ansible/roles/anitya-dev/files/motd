Welcome to the Anitya development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* Start and stop the development server with
  `systemctl --user {action} anitya.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl --user-unit anitya.service`

* Start and stop the check_service with
  `systemctl --user {action} check-service.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl --user-unit check-service.service`

* Start and stop the librariesio-consumer with
  `systemctl --user {action} librariesio-consumer.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl --user-unit librariesio-consumer.service`

Once you start the development server, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your host's browser.

Happy hacking!
