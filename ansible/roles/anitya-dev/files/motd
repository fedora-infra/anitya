Welcome to the Anitya development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* Start and stop the development server with
  `systemctl --user {action} anitya.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl --user-unit anitya.service`

* You can type `workon anitya` to enter a configured Python virtualenv


Once you start the development server, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your host's browser.

Happy hacking!
