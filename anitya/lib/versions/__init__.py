This package defines a set of version scheme plugins.

Anitya attempts to determine the newest version for a project. To do this, it
must be able to both parse and compare all the major version schemes, and handle
unknown version schemes in a reasonable way.

The general approach is as follows:

1. If a project has its ``version_scheme`` column defined in the database, that
   version scheme is used.

2. If the project does not have ``version_scheme`` set, but is in an ecosystem
   with a default version scheme, the ecosystem default is used.

2. If the project is not a part of an ecosystem or if the ecosystem has no
   default scheme, but the backend it uses has a default version scheme defined,
   the backend default is used.

4. If all else fails, Anitya uses the value of :data:`GLOBAL_DEFAULT`.
