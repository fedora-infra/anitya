"""
A backend for the R package host, `CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_.

CRAN does not provide a specific API, so this uses the `MetaCRAN <https://www.r-pkg.org/>`_
JSON API instead:

  * An HTTP GET request to ``https://crandb.r-pkg.org/{name}`` returns information about the `latest
    version of the package <https://github.com/metacran/crandb#pkg-latest-version-of-a-package>`_.
    We read the ``Version`` key from this response.
  * An HTTP GET request to ``https://crandb.r-pkg.org/{name}/all`` returns information about `all
    versions <https://github.com/metacran/crandb#pkgall-all-versions-of-a-package>`_. The
    ``versions`` key in the response contains a dictionary keyed by version and with values
    corresponding to the previous request above.
  * An HTTP GET request to ``https://crandb.r-pkg.org/-/pkgreleases?descending=true&limit=50``
    returns information on `all package releases
    <https://github.com/metacran/crandb#-pkgreleases-package-releases>`_, in order of release.
    The response is a list of dictionaries with the ``package`` key containing the same results as
    the first request above.
