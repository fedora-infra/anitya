"""
This module contains the `SQLAlchemy event listeners`_ for Anitya.

Anitya uses `SQLAlchemy event listeners`_ to perform tasks based on database
events. For example, when a new project is committed to the database, Anitya
publishes a message using `fedmsg`_.

.. note::
    In the future many events in this module should be accomplished with
    ``SessionEvents.pending_to_persistent``, but unfortunately that's new in
    1.1.0 and for the moment we need to support older versions of SQLAlchemy.
