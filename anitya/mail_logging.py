    """Logging filter that adds context to log records.

    Filters are typically used to "filter" log records.  They declare a filter
    method that can return True or False.  Only records with 'True' will
    actually be logged.

    Here, we somewhat abuse the concept of a filter.  We always return true,
    but we use the opportunity to hang important contextual information on the
    log record to later be used by the logging Formatter.  We don't normally
    want to see all this stuff in normal log records, but we *do* want to see
    it when we are emailed error messages.  Seeing an error, but not knowing
    which host it comes from, is not that useful.
