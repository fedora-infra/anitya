"""
A `sseclient`_ wrapper that is designed to consumed `libraries.io firehose`_ SSE feed.

Using this, it is possible for Anitya to discover new upstream releases using
`libraries.io`_. At the moment, the SSE feed is served over HTTP, so we confirm
the release is really available upstream before announce the new version.

        If the project is unknown to Anitya, a new :class:`Project` is created,

        If it's an existing project, this will call Anitya's ``check_project_release``
        API to update the latest version information. This is because we are
        subscribed to libraries.io over HTTP and therefore have no
        authentication.

        Checking the version ourselves serves two purposes. Firstly, we connect
        to libraries.io over HTTP so we don't have any authentication.
        Secondly, we might map the libraries.io project to the wrong Anitya
        project, so this is a good opportunity to catch those problems.
