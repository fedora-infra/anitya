"""
This module provides functions and classes for authentication and authorization.

Anitya uses `Flask-Login`_ for user session management. It handles logging in,
logging out, and remembering usersâ€™ sessions over extended periods of time.

In addition, Anitya uses `Python Social Auth`_ to authenticate users from various
third-party identity providers. It handles logging the user in and creating
:class:`anitya.db.models.User` objects as necessary.
