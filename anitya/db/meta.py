This module sets up the basic database objects that all our other modules will
rely on. This includes the declarative base class and global scoped session.

This is in its own module to avoid circular imports from forming. Models and
events need to be imported by ``__init__.py``, but  they also need access to
the :class:`Base` model and :class:`Session`.
