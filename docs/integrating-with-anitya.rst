Integrating with Anitya
=======================

This chapter describes ways how you can integrate Anitya with your solution.


Fedora messaging
================

`Fedora messaging`_ is a message bus. In other words it is a
system that allows for the sending and receiving of notifications between
applications.  For anitya, every action made on the application is
announced/broadcasted on this bus, allowing anyone listening to it to act
immediately instead of (for example) polling hourly all the data, looking for
changes, and acting then.

To start receiving `Fedora messaging`_ messages from anitya,
it is as simple as:

* install ``Fedora messaging`` the way you want:

On Fedora ::

  dnf install fedora-messaging

Via pip ::

  pip install fedora-messaging

For how to start a local broker for `fedora messaging`. See
`Fedora messaging documentation <https://fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#local-broker>`_.
