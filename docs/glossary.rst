    ecosystem
        Many programming languages now provide a package manager and public
        collection of packages for that language. Examples include the Python
        Package Index (PyPI), Rust's Cargo, or JavaScript's NPM.

    backend
        A backend in Anitya defines how to retrieve versions in a particular
        way. For example, some backends might use an API, while others use
        regular expressions to extract the versions from a web page.
