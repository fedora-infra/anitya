======
Anitya
======

Anitya is a release monitoring project. It provides a user-friendly interface
to add, edit, or browse projects. A cron job can be configured to regularly
scan for new releases of projects. When Anitya discovers a new release for a
project, it publishes a RabbitMQ messages via `fedora messaging`_.
This makes it easy to integrate with Anitya and perform actions when a new
release is created for a project. For example, the Fedora project runs a service
called `the-new-hotness <https://github.com/fedora-infra/the-new-hotness/>`_
which files a Bugzilla bug against a package when the upstream project makes a
new release.
