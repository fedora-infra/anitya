Welcome to the Anitya Web development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at /app

The development server is running on http://localhost:5000/.

* To start check service simply run `check_service`

* To start tests run `tox`

* To apply changes run `make restart` outside the container

Happy hacking!
